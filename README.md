# Sci-kit-Learn-Lab
This code shows how to create a neural network with multiple hidden layers using the sklearn library in python. The neural network is then trained on the car evaluation dataset and the classification report is displayed using confusion matrix and various measures such as precision, recall and f-score. Pre-processing of the data (such as categorical to numerical, standard scaling, normalization) is performed before training. Train-test-split is used to separate training and test data. Libraries such as Numpy, pandas, preprocessing are used for data processing.
