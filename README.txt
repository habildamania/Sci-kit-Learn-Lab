# SCIKIT-LEARN LAB

In this assignment, a neural network is created for the dataset named "Car Evaluation Dataset".
This assignment implements a neural net using the sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier() from the Scikit-learn library in python.


### About the dataset
The dataset used is the "Car Evaluation Dataset".
Derived from simple hierarchical decision model, this database may be useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.
It has three categorical classes: unacc, acc and vgood


### Executing the code
Open the .ipynb notebook using the shareable link provided
To execute each cell separately, click on the cell and press "CMD + enter"(MAC) or "ctrl + Enter"(Windows) 

## Output
The output of all the cells will include:
1. The dataframe extracted from the dataset using pandas
2. The label encoded dataframe after performing categorical to numerical conversions
3. The accuracy_score of the test dataset
4. The confusion matrix and the classification report(precision, recall,f1 score and support)

## Built With
Google Colab online python 3 notebook:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Fx3tQGJBU4PeBjwDFirMNjgFMYqU-oa


## License
The code for Neural network was imported from sklearn. Other data processing libraries like pandas was used for array processing.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge google colab for this elegant coding notebook.
I would also like to extend a Thank you to Prof. Anurag Nagar for providing a skeleton for this code .

## Note
Since, UCI's website has become non functional. The same dataset was obtained from
